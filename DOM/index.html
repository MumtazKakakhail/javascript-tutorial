      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents
      the structure and content of web documents (like HTML and XML) as a tree
      of objects. This model allows developers to dynamically access, modify,
      and interact with the content, structure, and style of a webpage using
      languages such as JavaScript.
